Name,Description
cryncoin,"CRYNcoin(CRYN) is a token that emerged with the digital financial evolution. Simultaneously, the team aims to fight against poverty worldwide with the help of theCRYNtoken. Also, the project builds a decentralized platform that could govern itself."
open-governance-token,"OpenDAO protocol is a conduit between real world assets and crypto assets with a proprietary real-world-asset backed stable coin. It serves as a place where people and businesses can borrow against tokenized assets and lenders can be rewarded for providing their liquidity.OpenDAO enables real world assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate to be used meaningfully in the DeFi ecosystem via permissionless, trust minimized, transparent, secure and automated protocols."
bitcoin,"Invented in 2008 and launched in early 2009, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was invented by someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is still unclear whether this name represents one person or a group of people.Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system that allows users to transfer value between each other without requiring a trusted third party to act as an intermediary. The design of the Bitcoin protocol prevents double spending and the arbitrary creation of new coins.Key Bitcoin features:	The first decentralized digital currency	Extremely high security due to proof-of-work and blockchain design	Fully transparent history of transactions and predictable supply timelineBitcoin transactions are recorded in a fully transparent public ledger called the blockchain. Approximately every 10 minutes, Bitcoin transactions are batched into a block and added to the ledger. The blocks reference each other  this is where the chain part of blockchain comes from.In order to ensure the security of the network, Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work algorithm. The process of facilitating transactions and creating new coins is referred to as mining. Miners deploy their computers to solve resource-intensive mathematical problems  the miner that reaches the correct solution first has the privilege of adding the next block to the Bitcoin blockchain and receives a reward in the form of BTC for their trouble.However, the reward received by miners is cut in half approximately every 4 years in what are known as Bitcoin halvings. The maximum supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins. The last Bitcoin will be mined around the year 2140, according to estimates.Each BTC can be subdivided in 100 million units called satoshis. This means that you dont have to buy a whole BTC in order to invest in Bitcoin.One satoshi is the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that can exist. Satoshis are commonly referred to as sats by cryptocurrency fans.The more computing power thats used for mining Bitcoin, the more robust the network becomes, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a single entity to intentionally promote invalid transactions or re-arrange the history of the ledger.The Bitcoin network is permissionless, which means that anyone can become a miner and participate in its consensus process.Bitcoin started off as a niche interest for cryptography and technology enthusiasts and eventually exploded in popularity, with the BTC price growing to thousands of dollars.With Bitcoins rise in value and popularity, the technology that makes Bitcoin possible was started being leveraged for a number of use cases, leading to the emergence of crypto assets as an asset class - practically every cryptocurrency on the market today employs some of the concepts introduced by Bitcoin.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Bitcoin price, market cap and news."
bitcoin-nft,"Bitcoin NFT is an ecosystem utility token initiative that features an NFTMarketPlace, allowing users to buy, sell and even create NFTs. The team also set up an exchange for swaps where users can exchange their coins to other cryptocurrencies, and theyll launch the new project on swap exchange. They will also develop a social platform that will offer detailed analysis on a new crypto project, and users can communicate with the crypto community on a single platform. Bitcoin NFT aims to protect cyrpto investors from rugged projects and provide detailed analysis as per their preferences."
bitcoin-defi,"Bitcoin DEFI will potentially create entirely new financial markets, products, and services. An ecosystem of financial applications that is built on top of blockchain networks. An open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem that is available to everyone and operates without any central authority. The users would maintain full control over their assets and interact with this ecosystem through peer-to-peer (P2P), decentralized applications (dapps)."
ethereum,"Ethereum is a blockchain network that was launched in July of 2015. While there were numerous founders behind the project, Ethereum was initially proposed by Vitalik Buterin. In order to fund development, the project sold rights to ETH tokens in a sale that took place between July and August of 2014. The currency used by the participants to purchase ETH was Bitcoin. The Ethereum project raised approximately $16 million worth of BTC in its initial coin offering.Key Ethereum features:	Launched in 2015 after a 2014 ICO that raised $16 million	Leading smart contract and dApp platform	Users can create custom tokens that run on top of Ethereum	Ethereum uses proof-of-work but is transitioning to proof-of-stakeEthereum makes it possible for users to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Once these apps and contracts are deployed to the Ethereum network, they are executed exactly as programmed and are exceedingly difficult to censor.The Ethereum network is secured through proof-of-work, similarly to the design employed by Bitcoin. However, the goal is for Ethereum to transition to proof-of-stake consensus to improve the scalability of the network and reduce the negative environmental impact of mining.ETH is the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, and it is used to pay the fees necessary for sending transactions and interacting with dApps. However, ETH is not the only asset that can be sent through Ethereum  users can create custom tokens and set the parameters such as the maximum supply to their liking.In fact, this was one of the features that enabled Ethereum to get a lot traction within the cryptocurrency community. Ethereums technology enabled projects to run initial coin offerings (ICOs), and Ethereum continues to be the most popular platform for token sales.On Ethereum, users can also create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which is a unique use-case enabled by blockchain technology  NFTs are verifiably scarce digital objects, which is why theyre sometimes called crypto collectibles. CryptoKitties is an example of a dApp that leverages NFTs.One of the major emerging trends in the Ethereum ecosystem is decentralized finance, commonly referred to with the abbreviation DeFi. This term refers to the numerous protocols built on top of Ethereum that allow users to lend, borrow, buy and sell their cryptocurrency without having to trust an intermediary in the process.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Ethereumprice, market cap and news."
compumar,It is a large-scale blockchain education experiment. It is a basic part of saving the economy.
tether,"USDT is a stablecoin thats targeting a $1 peg. The stablecoin was originally introduced in 2015 by Tether, a company that shares multiple high-ranking officials with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.Key USDT features:	Launched in 2015	Designed to trade as close to $1 as possible	The largest stablecoin by market cap and trading volume	Available on multiple blockchain platformsUSDT usually trades very close to its $1 peg target since the tokens can be redeemed for USD on a 1:1 basis through its issuer, Tether. The minimum amount of USDT that can be redeemed directly through Tether is 100,000 tokens ($100,000), which means that the everyday cryptocurrency trader will eventually have to convert their USDT into another cryptocurrency or use an exchange that lists USDT against a fiat currency. USDT/fiat pairs are currently quite rare to find, but they do exist  Kraken is an example of an exchange where USDT can be converted to USD and vice versa (as of February 2020).This model has generally proven to be a success with USDT being listed on a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges and becoming one of the most traded crypto assets in the world, as traders value the ability to quickly switch between volatile cryptocurrencies and a more stable asset. The bulk of USDT trading is done against traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.USDT was initially launched through the Omni Protocol, a solution which makes it possible to create custom tokens that leverage the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Omni-based USDT tokens are still in circulation, but USDT tokens have since also been issued on Ethereum, EOS, TRON, Algorand and Liquid Network.The transparency of Tether has been called into question in the cryptocurrency community on numerous occasions and this has opened up the door for alternative stablecoins like USD Coin, Paxos Standard Token, True USD and Dai to enter the market. Despite its controversial status, competitors have so far been unable to pose a real challenge to Tether and USDT remains by far the largest stablecoin both in terms of market capitalization and trading volume.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the USDT price, market cap and news."
binance-coin,"Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency that was sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Binance raised around $15 million through its ICO by selling 100 million BNB tokens (half of the total supply).Key Binance Coin features:	Issued in 2017 by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange	Holding the token provides trading fee discounts on the Binance exchange	Native asset of the Binance Chain blockchainThe Binance exchange was launched in July of 2017 - with the exchanges rapid rise to the top of the industry, the BNB cryptocurrency has also quickly advanced up the market cap rankings.Originally, BNB existed on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 standard token. However, the tokens were migrated to their own blockchain called Binance Chain in 2019. BNB functions as a native asset of the Binance Chain blockchain, and it is necessary to pay for certain Binance Chain operations such as paying fees on Binance DEX or creating new assets.Holding BNB on the Binance exchange gives traders certain benefits  trading fees are 25% lower if paid in the form of BNB, and holding the coin is also necessary to enter token sales on Binance Launchpad. However, the 25% discount will likely be lowered in future years.Every quarter, Binance burns a portion of their BNB holdings with the eventual goal of cutting the maximum BNB supply from 200 million to 100 million. Since it started as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, BNB is not mined, but the entire supply of 200 million was minted at launch.Binance is trying to expand the utility of BNB by securing partnerships with various service providers who accept BNB as payment. BNB can of course be traded on Binance, but its popularity has resulted in other exchanges also listing the coin.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Binance Coin price, market cap and news."
usd-coin,"USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin thats designed to trade as closely to $1 as possible. USDC functions on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 standard token, making it suitable for use in smart contracts, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. USDC is used extensively in popular DeFi apps such as Compound and Aave. USDC is also accepted as collateral in the MakerDAO system.USD Coin was created in 2018 by CENTRE, a consortium established by prominent cryptocurrency industry companies Coinbase and Circle. Key USD Coin features:	Launched in 2018 by CENTRE	Functions as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain	Fiat-collateralized stablecoin	Used in the Ethereum ecosystem as well as on centralized exchangesUSD Coin employs a traditional centralized stablecoin design, and derives its value from US dollar reserves held by its issuer. Each month, the issuer of USD Coin releases an attestation by accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP, showing that the issuer holds enough US dollars to back all of the circulating USDC tokens on a 1:1 basis. USDC can be redeemed for USD on a 1:1 basis with the coins issuer.As a stablecoin, the idea behind USDC is to provide the benefits of blockchain technology (24/7, global and fast transactions) without the downside of price volatility. However, users should be aware that USDC, like most other stablecoins,is issued by a centralized entity which has the power to blacklist addresses and freeze tokens.In 2018, we saw a flood of new stablecoin projectsthat were trying to deliver a serious competitor to Tethers USDT. So far, USDC has been the most successful alternative stablecoin, establishinga firm lead over other USDT competitors in terms of market capitalization. Other notable USDT competitors include Paxos Standard Token, True USD, Binance USD and HUSD.In 2020, USD Coins market capitalization surpassed the $1 billion milestone for the first time."

cardano,"Cardano is a cryptocurrency project thats creating a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications with a focus on advanced functionality and scalability. The native asset of the Cardano blockchain is called ADA, and it can also be used for simple value transfers just like any other cryptocurrency. The maximum supply of ADA is set at 45 billion coins.Key Cardano features:	Launched in 2017 after $62.2 million ICO	Blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications	Based on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism	IOHK, Cardano Foundation and Emurgo are the main organizations in the Cardano ecosystemIn order to fund development, the Cardano project raised $62.2 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) that was completed in January of 2017.One of the leading figures behind Cardano is Charles Hoskinson, who was one of the initial founders of the Ethereum project. However, Hoskinson left Ethereum as he did not share the teams vision for the future direction of the project.Cardano is known in the cryptocurrency community as an ambitious project with a rigorous approach to development  for example, the protocols Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol has been subject to academic peer review.The Cardano project has three main arms which serve different functions within the ecosystem  IOHK, Cardano Foundation and Emurgo. IOHK takes care of the technical development of the Cardano protocol, the Cardano Foundation promotes the adoption of Cardano, while Emurgo is primarily focused on commercial applications of Cardanos technology.For its smart contracts, Cardano uses a programming language called Plutus. According to the project, Plutus provides significant security advantages over other programming languages used for smart contracts.Cardano divides its roadmap into 5 major phases, with each focusing on a specific aspect of the Cardano protocol. Heres the phases listed from first to last:	Byron (Foundation)	Shelley (Decentralization)	Goguen (Smart contracts)	Basho (Scaling)	Voltaire (Governance)On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Cardano price, market cap and news."

dogecoin,"Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was born out of the Shiba Inu doge meme that took the world by storm in 2013. The coin was introduced as a joke initially in December 2013 and included an image of the Doge meme as its logo. The currency nevertheless took off, developing a significant community via platforms such as Reddit. By 2015, over 100 billion Doge has been mined. Although the currency is regarded as a joke by more serious investors, it still retains its uses, primarily as a means of tipping and for performing similar micro-transactions. In keeping with Doges humorous origins, a Doge gold coin has been earmarked for delivery to the moon by 2019 thanks to a crowdfunding effort. The currency was created by Billy Markus who hoped that Dogecoin would attract a demographic who werent aware of or interested in Bitcoin.Dogecoin 2.0 has no affiliation with the Dogecoin Foundation."
shiba-inu,"SHIBA INU is a community-driven experiment project where half of the token supply was locked, and the other half was sent to Vitalik Buterin."

polygon,"Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum which aims to provide major scalability improvements for decentralized applications by utilizing a modified version of Plasma with sidechains based on Proof-of-Stake."
litecoin,"Litecoin is a very well-established cryptocurrency, as it was one of the very first coins to gain traction after Bitcoin entered the scene in 2009. Litecoin was launched in 2011 by computer scientist Charlie Lee and has been one of the most relevant altcoins for practically its entire existence.Litecoin was created as a fork of the Bitcoin Core client and still shares many of its defining characteristics with Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency it is often said that if Bitcoin represents gold, Litecoin represents silver.Key Litecoin features:	Created by Charlie Lee as a fork of Bitcoin in 2011	Shares many properties with Bitcoin, but enables faster transactions	Uses Scrypt-based PoW instead of SHA256-based PoWLitecoins block time target is four times faster than Bitcoins (2.5 minutes compared to 10 minutes). Litecoins maximum supply cap is four times larger than Bitcoins (84 million compared to 21 million).Similarly to Bitcoin, the Litecoin blockchain also reaches consensus through a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. However, Litecoin doesnt use a SHA256-based PoW algorithm, but instead uses a Scrypt-based algorithm.These features allows the Litecoin blockchain to process transactions faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.Litecoin also has a block reward halving mechanism, which occurs approximately every four years. The latest Litecoin halving, which occurred in 2019, lowered the LTC reward from 25 LTC per block to 12.5 LTC per block.In general, Litecoin is seen as a faster but less robust alternative to Bitcoin. Due to its comparably faster speed, Litecoin advocates are actively promoting LTC as a cryptocurrency that is convenient for use in everyday transactions.In the future, Litecoin could potentially have features that would make it much more than Bitcoins little brother. For example, Litecoin developers are experimenting with implementing the MimbleWimble privacy technology into Litecoin to enable private LTC transactions.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Litecoin price, market cap and news."
near-protocol,NEAR is a secure decentralized storage and compute platform that allows users to manage high-value assets like money or identity.
tron,"Tron is a blockchain platform that went live with its mainnet in June of 2018. Prior to the mainnet launch, the platforms native asset TRX existed as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The Tron blockchain is designed to host smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Similarly to the concept popularized by Ethereum, Tron can also be used to issue custom blockchain-based tokens.Key Tron features:	Delegated proof-of-stake consensus model	Fast transactions and low transaction fees	Decentralized applications (DApps)	Users can create custom tokens using the TRC10 and TRC20 standardsThe Tron project was founded by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun, and its development is headed by the Tron Foundation, which was established in 2017. The TRX token started trading on cryptocurrency exchanges in September of 2017. Justin Sun acquired San Francisco-based tech company BitTorrent Inc. in 2018. By leveraging the sizeable existing user base of BitTorrent Inc.s products, the Tron team aims to boost the adoption of the Tron blockchain. BitTorrent launched BitTorrent Token (BTT), its own token on the Tron blockchain, in 2019.The Tron platform aims to provide the scalability required to support popular DApps by employing a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) architecture. This design allows the Tron network to perform fast transactions with minimal fees.TRX holders use their tokens to vote for Super Representatives (SRs), which maintain the Tron blockchain. At any given time, the 27 SR candidates with the most votes are active and take part in the Tron blockchains consensus process.Some of Trons biggest competitors when it comes to popular blockchain platforms for smart contracts and DApps are EOS and Ethereum. Projects such as BitTorrent and WINk have used the Tron platform to create their own tokens and raised funding through token sales.CoinCodex keeps you updated with real-time information about the Tron price, Tron ICOs and decentralized applications that run on the Tron blockchain."
chainlink,"The Chainlink project isdeveloping a framework that allows developers to build decentralized oracles that provide reliable data to smart contracts.In essence, Chainlinkaims to provide a solution for the oracle problem faced by smart contract-enabled blockchain platforms such asEthereum. Smart contracts make it possible to execute code in a decentralized and trustless manner when pre-determined conditions are met.However, when smart contracts have to make use of real-world data such as the exchange rate between two different assets, an obvious problem arises. Even though the execution of the smart contract itself may be decentralized and trustless, the oracles which feed data to it can easily be manipulated or otherwise untrustworthy.Key Chainlink information:	Decentralized oracle network	Conducted an ICO in 2017, raising $32 million	Mainnet was launched in June of 2019	LINK tokens function on Ethereum through the ERC-677 standardChainlink makes it possible to establish decentralized oracle networks that provide inputs and outputs for snart contracts. These decentralzed oracle networks consist of multiple independent nodes, an agreed-upon method for collecting data, and external adaptors that provide access to APIs.The LINK token functions on the Ethereum platform as an ERC-677 standard token. ERC-677 tokens retain all of the properties of ERC-20 tokens, but sport some additional features. LINK tokens are necessary for compensating node operators. Node operators also use their LINK tokens as collateral. In simplified terms - if they submit bad data, they lose the LINK tokens they had to put up as collateral.The CEO of Chainlink is Sergey Nazarov, and while he may not be as active on his social media accounts as some of the other prominent figures from the crypto and blockchain industry, he is generally seen as the face of Chainlink in the crypto community."
uniswap,"UNI is a governance token for Uniswap, which is an automated liquidity protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. UNI tokens exist as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, and allow holders to influence the direction of the Uniswap project. UNI holders have ownership of Uniswaps governance process, the UNI community treasury, the protocols fee switch, and more.At launch, 15% of the total UNI supply was distributed to existing users of the Uniswap protocol. An additional 45%of the tokens supply has been allocated to the community of Uniswap users, and will be distributed through liquidity mining on supported Uniswap pools, and other distribution mechanisms."
ftx-token,FTT is the official token of the FTX cryptocurrency derivatives exchange.
bitcoin-cash,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that was created through a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain in August of 2017. Each holder of BTC could access the equivalent amount of BCH after the fork was completed.In short, the reason for the fork was that the Bitcoin community split in two camps who had very different ideas on how to ensure that the Bitcoin network is sufficiently scalable.One of the biggest difference is that Bitcoin Cash has a much higher block size limit  the argument surrounding Bitcoins block size limit was one of the most contentious points in the debate that led to the 2017 hard fork.Key Bitcoin Cash features:	Created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in 2017	Differs from Bitcoin by using a different approach to scaling	Uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanismThe maximum block size of a Bitcoin Cash block is 32 megabytes, while the maximum block size of a Bitcoin block is one megabyte. Bitcoin Cashs increased block size allows it to handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin, but the higher block size limit comes with its own downsides as well  for example, it is more expensive to operate a full node.Many proponents of Bitcoin Cash say that the cryptocurrency is fulfilling Satoshi Nakamotos original idea of a peer-to-peer electronic cash. In general, the medium of exchange function of cryptocurrency is emphasized more strongly by the Bitcoin Cash community compared to the Bitcoin community.While Bitcoin Cash is considerably smaller than Bitcoin, the coin has successfully established itself as one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BCH is listed by virtually all major cryptocurrency exchanges and is supported by several cryptocurrency wallets.Bitcoin Cash itself went through a contentious hard fork in 2018, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin SV.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Bitcoin Cash price, market cap and news."
unus-sed-leo,"UNUS SED LEO (LEO) is a utility token issued by Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange thats one crypto industrys leaders when it comes to spot market liquidity. Like most other cryptocurrency exchange tokens, holding the LEO gives certain benefits for users of the exchange. Users who hold LEO enjoy reduced trading fees, funding fee discounts, and additional benefits from the exchanges referral program. LEO tokens have been issued on both the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.Basic UNUS SED LEO (LEO) features:	A token that has been issued on both Ethereum and EOS	Gives special benefits to Bitfinex users	Bitfinex parent company iFinex uses 27% of its consolidated gross revenues to buy back LEO tokens	Transparent buyback and burning mechanismThe LEO token was launched in May of 2019 after Bitfinexraised $1 billion by selling the tokens to investors in a private sale. This was one of the biggesttoken sales of all time, alongside EOS, Filecoin, TezosandTelegram Open Network.One of the main reasons why Bitfinex launched LEO was to secure funding afterpayment processing company Crypto Capital, whichBitfinex previously worked with, allegedly lost $880 million of Bitfinexs funds.iFinex, the parent company of Bitfinex, uses 27% of its consolidated gross revenues to buy back LEO tokens from the open market with the goal of eventually removing the entire supply of LEO from commercial circulation. The company also says that it will use any funds that it recovers from Crypto Capital to buy back LEO tokens.LEO is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange-issued tokens by market capitalization, and it is comparable to tokens issued by the likes of Binance, OKEx and Crypto.com.Interesting LEO statistics such as LEOssupply and burn dynamics are available on the LEO transparency dashboard provided by Bitfinex."
okb,"OKB is a utility token issued by the OKB foundation. OKB isaccepted on OKEx and it`s a vital piece of its architecture  development. Through the highly complementary relationship, OKB will be applied not only on the OKEx platform but on other related projects as well."
algorand,"Algorand is a cryptocurrency that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Launched in 2019, Algorand was initially developed by Algorand Inc., a company founded by Silvio Micali. Micali is a computer science professor at the prestigious MIT university and is a recipient of both the Turing Award and the Gdel Prize.Key Algorand Features:	A blockchain platform based on pure proof-of-stake (PPoS)	Permissionless network where anyone can participate in the consensus process	Fast transactions with immediate finality	Supports custom assets and smart contractsAlgorands consensus protocol is called pure proof-of-stake (PPoS). In Algorand, the process of staking is not delegated, and each user receives a reward proportional to their stake when a new block is added to the Algorand blockchain. Each holder of ALGO can participate in the blockchains consensus process. The protocols design is also geared towards preventing hard forks.ALGO can be used in a manner similar to Bitcoin, for simple peer-to-peer value transfers. Transactions are completed in a matter of seconds and transactions achieve finality as soon as they are included in a block.However, the Algorand blockchain also allows users to create custom assets, opening up the possibility for using Algorand to tokenize real-world assets or issue tokenized securities. The tokens that can be created on Algorand are referred to as Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs).The Algorand protocol also supports smart contracts written in a programming language called TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language). The smart contracts operate on Algorands first layer, improving efficiency.Atomic swaps are another feature supported by the Algorand protocol, and it makes it possible for different assets to be transferred between multiple parties simultaneously.Despite being a relatively new crypto asset, ALGO has already been listed on many of the worlds leading cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and Bitfinex.On CoinCodex, you can stay up to date with the latest information regarding the Algorand price, market cap and news."

Abracadabra offers an opportunity to use it."
decentraland,"Decentraland is a virtual reality platform that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications on the Ethereum network."
stellar,"Stellar is a blockchain project founded in 2014 by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb and venture capital investor Joyce Kim. At the beginning, Stellar shared a lot of its code with the XRP ledger, but the project has since taken on unique characteristics of its own. However, the XRP and Stellar blockchains are still often compared since they both offer fast and cheap transactions and share some common history. You can read more on this topic in our in-depth article on Stellar (XLM).Key features of the Stellar blockchain:	Created in 2014	Provides fast and cheap transactions	XLM can be used as a bridge currency for international payments	Users can create custom tokens on the Stellar blockchainThe native asset of the Stellar blockchain is called lumens, and is commonly described with the ticker XLM. While XLM can be used for peer-to-peer transactions just like any other cryptocurrency, it also performs a role in the Stellar blockchain as a defense mechanism against spam transactions  a small fee of XLM is necessary to complete each transaction.XLM is also designed to be used as a bridge currency to facilitate cross-border transfers between different currencies. For example, Alice can send EUR to Bob, and Bob receives USD on the other end of the transaction. Due to the networks speed, fluctuations in the XLM price have a very limited impact on the transaction.However, XLM is not the only asset that can be transferred through the Stellar blockchain  users can create custom tokens that can be transacted quickly and efficiently. For this reason, some ICOs and STOs have selected Stellar as their platform of choice.The Stellar protocol also has a built-in decentralized exchange functionality where users can create buy and sell orders through the protocol itself  this feature can be accessed through interfaces such as StellarX.One of the key players in the Stellar ecosystem is the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), which funds the development of the open-source Stellar protocol and maintains the Stellar codebase.The foundation is a non-profit organization which also supports the Stellar ecosystem by promoting the usage of the Stellar protocol through airdrops, grants and other mechanisms. The SDF has also launched a community fund which allows members of the Stellar community to have a say in which projects working on Stellar receive funding from the foundation."
ethereum-classic,"Ethereum Classic is one of the two crypto assets that emerged after a hard fork of the Ethereum network in 2016. Before the fork, there were strong disagreements within the Ethereum community on how to respond to the infamous DAO hack, in which a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAOs smart contract system, resultingin more than $50 million worth of ETH becominginaccessible.One part of the Ethereum community advocated for a hard fork in which the damage done by the DAO hacker would effectively be rolled back and erased from the blockchains history. This part of the Ethereum community backed the Ethereum chain as we know it today, with ETH as its native asset.The other part of the Ethereum community maintained that immutability was a crucial aspect of blockchains, even though it might sometimes lead to undesirable outcomes. This camp opposed the idea of a hard fork being used to essentially alter the history of what happened on the Ethereum blockchain. This part of the Ethereum community supported the side of the hard fork that is known today as Ethereum Classic, with ETC as its native asset. The consequences of the DAO hack are still present on the Ethereum Classic blockchain.Key Ethereum Classic features:	The Ethereum Classic name was started being used in 2016 after the Ethereum community split in two opposing camps	Maintains the continuity of the Ethereum blockchain	Uses proof-of-work to secure the ledger of transactions and theres currently no plans to transition to proof-of-stake	Unlike with ETH, the total supply of ETC is cappedThe basic premise of Ethereum Classic is the same as Ethereums - users can create smart contracts and decentralized applications that leverage the security of the blockchain network. This is made possible through the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is a Turing-complete virtual machine.However, the two projects roadmaps have major differences - for example, the Ethereum project is planning a transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model, while Ethereum Classic plans to stick with the existing proof-of-work model. Ethereum Classic has also implemented a maximum cap for the ETC supply (210.7 million coins), while there is no supply cap for ETH."
internet-computer,"Internet Computer, previously known as Dfinity, is building a decentralized internet computer, a cloud computing platform that aims to compete with centralized giants such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The project launched back in 2016 with the goal to build the Internet Computer, a blockchain-based decentralized network that will expand the functionality of the internet as we know it today. The cloud-like platform will allow users to store data, perform computation, and support community-driven governance.The project began its fundraising back in 2017, where theyve raised more than $100M by the end of 2018. Early investors received an IOU-ICP version of the token, that allowedthem to buy, sell and hold the native token of the blockchain that is not yet gone live. On May 7, 2021 the team went live with their mainnet, while the ICP token was publicly launched a few days later on May 10, 2021."

The Monero whitepaper was created by an unknown person using the pseudonym Nicolas van Saberhagen.With Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other cryptocurrencies, the ledger of transactions is fully transparent  you can head to any Bitcoin or Ethereum explorer and see the entire list of transactions made through their respective networks, including the sender, recipient, and amount.Key Monero features:	Privacy-focused proof-of-work cryptocurrency	Transaction amounts, senders and recipients are obscured to outside observers	Can be mined efficiently with consumer-grade computer hardwareMonero uses a suite of privacy-enhancing technologies including ring signatures and stealth addresses to obscure the senders, recipients and amounts involved in any given Monero transaction. Aside from enabling privacy, this also has a positive effect on Moneros fungibility, as specific XMR coins cannot be blacklisted by service providers such as cryptocurrency exchanges. In short, you can be certain that you will be able to spend your XMR coins with any service provider that accepts Monero.Monero is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, meaning that it is secured through mining. Unlike what were seeing with many other cryptocurrencies, the Monero community is actively opposed to ASIC mining, due to its potential negative impact on decentralization. Instead, Monero is designed so that it can be mined efficiently using consumer-grade computer hardware.Cryptocurrencies that are focused on providing privacy are often referred to as privacy coins. In addition to Monero, this category also includes crypto assets such as Zcash, Horizen and Grin.Even though Monero is a well-respected project within the cryptocurrency community, Moneros uncompromising approach to privacy has made it a controversial cryptocurrency outside of the crypto sphere, as certain regulators and lawmakers have expressed concerns surrounding the technologys potential use in illicit activities."

eos,"EOS is a public blockchain that went live with its mainnet in June of 2018. Before its launch, it was one of the most highly anticipated blockchain projects of all time, as the team behind it raised a record-breaking $4 billion in its initial coin offering (ICO). Before the transition to its mainnet, EOS tokens existed as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network.Key EOS features:	Launched in 2018 after a record-breaking $4 billion ICO	Allows users to run DApps, smart contracts and create custom tokens	The EOS blockchain can handle thousands of transactions per secondThe EOSIO protocol, which is the backbone of the EOS blockchain, was developed by Block.one. One of the chief architects of EOS is Dan Larimer, a software developer and entrepreneur who also had a pivotal role in the development of the BitShares and Steem blockchains.In essence, EOS is a blockchain platform that allows users to deploy smart contracts, run decentralized applications (DApps) and issue custom tokens. While these features can be found on a number of other blockchains, EOS aims to distinguish itself from the competition through improved scalability and faster transaction speeds. The EOS network can handle over 3,000 transactions per second.EOS utilizes a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) model to achieve consensus about the state of its ledger. The consensus process is executed by block producers (BPs), and each EOS holder can decide which block producers they want to vote for with their EOS tokens. At any given time, the 21 block producers with the most votes are actively participating in the consensus process. A unique feature of the EOS blockchain is that users dont have to pay any fees when sending transactions. The main competitors of EOS are other blockchain platforms that support the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications  examples include Ethereum and TRON. TRON is perhaps the best comparison, as its consensus model also utilizes delegated proof-of-stake.DApps deployed on the EOS network cover a wide range of use cases, including gaming, gambling, decentralized exchanges, freelancing platforms, decentralized information sources (Everipedia), and more.To learn more about EOS, check out our in-depth article on the topic."

The Maker Protocol allows users to lock up their crypto assets as collateral and receive a loan in the form of Dai, a stablecoin thats designed to trade as close to $1 as possible. The process is completely trustless, functioning through a system of smart contracts on EthereumIn addition to ETH, other Ethereum-based assets such as Basic Attention Token and USD Coin can also be used to generate Dai.Key Maker (MKR) features:	Launched in 2015	ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain	Used for Maker Protocol governance	Acts as a recapitalization source for the Maker Protocol	Initial supply was 1 million tokensMKR holders can propose changes and vote on various aspects on the Maker Protocol through governance polls and executive votes. Some of the aspects of the Maker Protocol that MKR holders can vote on are the protocols stability fees and the Dai Savings Rate.At launch, the total supply of MKR was 1 million tokens. However, the supply of MKR tokens can fluctuate depending on market circumstances within the Maker Protocol. This is because MKR is not just a governance token, but is also used as a recapitalization source for the Maker ProtocoI. Ifthere is an excess of DAI tokens in the system, they are auctioned off for MKR, which is then burned.Conversely, if there are not enough DAI tokens in the system, new MKR tokens are created and auctioned off for DAI. Such an auction took place in March of 2020, when a large drop in the price of ETH created issues for the Maker Protocol and resulted in a DAI deficit."

zcash,"Initially proposed in a publication entitled Zerocash in 2014, Zcash is a decentralized public peer-to-peer cryptocurrency launched in 2016 that offers features similar to Bitcoin with a twist of unique privacy and security features found only in a handful of public digital currencies.More specifically, ZEC was the first cryptocurrency to leverage zk-SNARKS, a zero-knowledge protocol that was considered among the top 10 breakthrough technologies of 2018 according to MITs Technology Review.Key Zcash features:	Launched in October of 2016	Proof-of-work cryptocurrency	Privacy features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs	Users can choose to send public or private transactionsZcash is a cryptocurrency thats primarily known for its privacy-enhancing features. Users can choose to preserve their privacy by sending shielded transactions. With shielded transactions, crucial information such as the addresses involved in the transaction andthe amount sent is not visible to the public.Alternatively, users can send unshielded transactions, which are completely transparent and function in a way thats very similar to Bitcoin.Zcash features two types of addresses - z-addresses (private) and t-addresses (transparent). These addresses can be easily identified by their first character. While ZEC transactions can be send between z-addresses and t-addresses, users have to be mindful of the privacy implications of such transfers.Aside from its innovative privacy features, ZEC is a pretty straightforward crypto asset thats primarily designed for peer-to-peer value transfers. For this purpose, it provides many of the same benefits as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other similar cryptocurrencies - the network operates 24/7, and money can be sent globally in a completely trustless manner.New ZEC coins are introduced into the circulating supply through mining - Zcash is a cryptocurrency based on proof-of-work. Tokenomics-wise, ZCash has kept the same 21 million total supply cap introduced by Bitcoin. Similarly to Bitcoin, Zcash also has a halving mechanism.

GAS, on the other hand, is divisible.The NEO blockchain achieves consensus through a dBFT (delegated byzantine fault tolerant) algorithm. There is no mining or staking in NEO, and the consensus process is handled by consensus nodes. As of January 2020, there are only 7 approved consensus nodes, although the NEO project is pushing towards further decentralization.Users can deploy their own custom digital assets that function on the NEO blockchain. For this reason, there have been a number of ICO projects that opted to conduct their token sales on NEO.

Each masternode has one vote that can be used to vote on key decisions regarding the Dash network, and they can also influence how the projects budget is used.The Dash mining reward is split into three portions. 45% of the reward goes to proof-of-work miners, 45% goes to masternode operators, while 10% is reserved for the Dash decentralized governance budget.The emission rate of new Dash coins entering circulation drops by 1/14 (~7.14%) approximately every 383 days.When new Dash coins stop being created (this will happen approximately in the year 2,254), the final supply of Dash will be somewhere between 17.74 million and 18.92 million coins. While this may seem strange, there is a pretty simple explanation - while 10% of the block reward is reserved for budget proposals, its not a guarantee that the community of Dash holders actually decides to allocate all of the reserved funds to budget proposals."

In addition, transactions can be set to expire after a certain amount of time has elapsed. If a transaction is held up on the network, for example, it can expire, preventing it from ever going through. Although a controversial coin, Decred has some high profile proponents including Litecoins Charlie Lee."

The protocol supports a number of Ethereum-based assets, including ETH and the USDT stablecoin. The process of lending and borrowing on Compound is facilitated in its entirety through smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in a trustless system.COMP tokens were initially distributed to Compound protocol users on June 16, 2020. Holders of COMP tokens have the power to propose and vote on changes to the Compound protocol. COMP holders can either choose to vote with the tokens themselves or delegate their voting rights to another address. This means that even users who dont hold COMP themselves can participate in Compounds governance process, if someone else delegates their voting rights to them.Any address with at least 1% of the COMP supply delegated to it is able to propose governance actions. A new proposal then goes through a voting period which last 3 days, and all users with voting power can either vote to support or reject the proposal. The threshold for a proposal being accepted is that the proposal has to have a majority of votes in support of it, provided there were at least 400,000 COMP votes in favor.Around 2,880 COMP tokens are distributed to Compound users on a daily basis, with 50% of the daily distribution going to suppliers (lenders) and 50% going to borrowers."
